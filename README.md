**Understanding the Problem:**
The task involves analyzing textual data extracted from articles to derive various metrics such as sentiment scores, readability indices, and linguistic features. These metrics provide insights into the nature, complexity, and style of the text.

**Approach Overview**

**1. Understanding the Problem:**

* At the outset, the problem entails analyzing textual data extracted from articles to derive meaningful insights and metrics.
* The metrics include sentiment scores, readability indices, and linguistic features, which collectively provide a comprehensive understanding of the text's characteristics.

**2. Data Preprocessing:**

* Text Cleaning: Employ NLTK's stopwords list to eliminate irrelevant words such as articles, prepositions, and punctuation marks. This step ensures that only meaningful content contributes to the analysis.

**3. Dictionary Creation:**

* Construct dictionaries of positive and negative words from provided files. These dictionaries serve as reference points for sentiment analysis, enabling the classification of words based on their emotional polarity.

**4. Derived Metrics Calculation:**

* **Sentiment Scores:** Count the occurrences of positive and negative words in the text using the created dictionaries. Positive score is incremented by +1 for each positive word, while negative score is decremented by -1 for each negative word.
* **Polarity Score:** Compute the polarity score, representing the overall sentiment polarity of the text. It is calculated as the normalized difference between positive and negative scores, ranging from -1 (negative) to +1 (positive).
* **Subjectivity Score:** Evaluate the subjectivity of the text based on the ratio of positive and negative word counts to the total word count. This metric indicates the extent to which the text expresses opinions or facts.
* **Readability Metrics:** Determine various readability indices including average sentence length, percentage of complex words, and Fog Index. These metrics assess the complexity and comprehensibility of the text.
* **Other Metrics:** Calculate additional linguistic features such as average word length, syllable count per word, and counts of personal pronouns. These metrics offer insights into the language style and structure of the text.

**5. Data Processing:**

* Organize the calculated metrics into a structured format, typically a DataFrame, using the Pandas library. This facilitates efficient data manipulation and analysis.

**6. Output Generation:**

* Export the DataFrame containing the calculated metrics to an Excel file. This file serves as the output, enabling further exploration, visualization, and interpretation of the analyzed text data.

1. **Text Cleaning:** Utilize NLTK's stopwords list to remove irrelevant words and symbols from the text.
2. **Dictionary Creation:** Construct dictionaries of positive and negative words from provided files.
3. **Derived Metrics Calculation:**
   * Sentiment Scores: Calculate positive and negative scores by counting occurrences of words in respective dictionaries.
   * Polarity Score: Determine the overall sentiment polarity of the text.
   * Subjectivity Score: Assess the subjectivity of the text based on word occurrences.
   * Readability Metrics: Compute average sentence length, percentage of complex words, Fog Index, and average words per sentence.
   * Other Metrics: Calculate counts of personal pronouns, average word length, and syllable count per word.
4. **Data Processing:** Organize the calculated metrics into a DataFrame.
5. **Output Generation:** Export the DataFrame to an Excel file for further analysis and visualization.
